        <h2>Marinette Dupain-Cheng</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the story, Marinette goes through a lot. She faces many trials, challenges, and problems, but has she changed for the better? Has she done more harm than good? Did she grow as a person from what we once knew her as? 
          In the first season, Marinette’s crush on Adrien, a classmate, drives her to questionable actions such as obsessively stalking him, watching him during his after-school activities, and even pre-planning birthday gifts for him years in advance. In the episode Copycat, she reveals her extensive knowledge of his schedule through a chart she created. Instead of simply asking him to spend time together, she devises overly complicated plans. Her friends in the early seasons enable and even participate in these schemes. Marinette’s perception and execution of love is harmful, not just to her, but also to those around her. She’s able to drag people down to her level in the sense that they’re either only silently judging or actively helping. The majority of what she plans and does is morally reprehensible in one interpretation or another, and she’s stuck in an echo chamber that allows this to continue. Her so-called friends make her more prone to overthinking and rather than getting genuine help, the situation always somehow ends in a happy ending letting her dodge accountability. A good friend makes you a better person, or atleast pushes you in that direction; Marinette’s friends barely do that. They care about her and in the episode Gang of Secrets, they get akumatized because Marinette pushes them away when the pressure of being ladybug and guardian gets to her. However caring about someone isn’t the same as being close and a persons’ friend. She establishes Lila as an enemy despite Lila being flawed yet ultimately innocent.
          Initially, she labels Kagami as an antagonist, framing her as "stealing" Adrien away from her, even though she hasn’t asked Adrien about his feelings and, therefore, has no right to decide what his love life looks like. Every time Adrien shows even the slightest interest in another girl, Marinette overreacts, causing unnecessary drama. She pushes Adrien away by glamorizing an idealized version of him, making it hard for her to see him as an equal, even when they are dating. While this is more clearly depicted in the reboot, it’s somewhat hinted at in the later seasons.

          Her character is often portrayed as selfish and, at times, pathetic, for prioritizing her obsession with Adrien over her friends, family, and loved ones. In the 2 part episode Style Queen, she initially told her parents that she was fine with handling the bakery during the event that their family was catering for. She was going to take on that responsibility to lighten the load on her parents, but once she knew that adrien would also be attending the event, she dropped it and begged them to let her go with them, knowing full well she’s clumsy. She put her family’s reputation on the line for a crush, and in this the same event, she labeled Kagami as an antagonist and lost the Bee Miraculous power of immobilization. While there are moments of growth, these are often overshadowed by her repeated mistakes and the painful, sometimes embarrassing attempts to win Adrien’s affection. Although some lessons are learned, the show’s plot often undermines her development, making it hard to see her grow consistently.
          <br>
          <br>
          Being in middle school is an awkward time to be in, and that's understandable. However, the show doesn’t frame Marinette as a typical teenager, instead presenting her as a capable, nearly adult character. Even if we consider her as a kid, it still doesn’t fully explain or justify her stalkerish behavior. She’s scaled brick walls just to spy on Adrien studying with a classmate, believing she’s “protecting” him. She’s even broken into Adrien’s room, snooping through his things and lying on his bed, all in the name of leaving him a present. She’s also used her powers, the Ladybug Miraculous or the literal power of creation, to manipulate situations and expose lies, even when the people involved haven't done anything inherently wrong.
          Lila, and her initial character, can be seen as relatively innocent compared to Marinette. While Lila is far from blameless, at that point in the story, she hadn't fully evolved into the manipulative character that she becomes later. She only ever becomes that manipulative and close to the villain, Hawkmoth, because of her hatred for Ladybug and Marinette for embarrassing her. This, in personal bias, is one of the worst things Marinette ever does because Lila is fundamentally perfect for the Fox Miraculous, the power of illusion, which through connections was given to Alya, her best friend, instead.
          <br>
          <br>
          [I will never forgive the story for removing such an amazingly smart character from the line of superheroes. The show would be much more compelling following Marinette, Lila, and Adrien teaming up. Marinette has improvisation and ingenuity, Lila has social intelligence and can manipulate people even without the Miraculous, and Adrien would’ve thrived being able to choose his own person with people who want to see him as himself. Lila is smart enough and would’ve been willing to bring and humble Marinette down when she needed to be, instead of her current so-called friends letting her get so out of hand. Lila would’ve been able to get Adrien’s father to be more involved, nicer even, not just to him but also to maybe Marinette, because they’re all friends.
          This is pretty much best case scenario, but from how the show frames it, Lila may have wanted Adrien all to herself and was lying to Marinette about giving her a chance. I wouldn’t put it past her, but that still would’ve made much more sense than what Marinette did. The story could’ve happened almost identically, but still, how that scene and episode were executed was painful.]
          <br>
          <br>
          Despite her flaws, Marinette remains a conceptually good character. In fan interpretations and rewrites, there’s a broad consensus about her moral integrity and quality. She’s portrayed as understanding, wise, and insightful, and her ingenuity shines through, especially in her use of the Lucky Charm. Throughout the series, Marinette has shown that she can solve problems and defeat villains with only limited resources, relying on her creativity and quick thinking. She brings out the best in the people around her, encouraging her friends to rise to the occasion.
          Marinette has worked hard to become a more confident person, and while the show doesn’t always handle this growth well, there’s still clear evidence of it. The lessons Marinette learns may seem regressed at times, but that often stems from the situations the plot places her in. It feels like she chooses her actions, but also that she’s pushed into them, without proper accountability. Whether she’s grown as a person depends on how you view the show. Do you believe the show itself is the only true interpretation? If so, then your answer is probably no. Or, do you think fan interpretations and artistic representations shape her character more? If that’s the case, there’s a clearer arc of development.

        <h2>Adrien Agreste</h2>
        <p>Adrien is introduced with a complex backstory. His father, Gabriel Agreste, is cold and distant, while his mother went missing recently, leaving Adrien to fend for himself emotionally. After her disappearance, his father isolates himself in his work, keeping Adrien homeschooled and sheltered. As a result, Adrien is forced to navigate his grief alone, without a real parental figure to support him. The burden of maintaining his father's expectations falls entirely on him. He feels trapped—not just by his loss but by what came after it. He struggles with his own identity, unable to decide who he wants to be, instead conforming to the image his parents envisioned for him. This struggle is even more intense when, as a son, you believe you are your father's expectations—that it is your responsibility to make him happy. Because of this, Adrien constantly puts himself second to others, creating a deep, unresolved emptiness within him.
          Everything in his life is dictated by his father’s vision: He models because his father is a fashion designer and expects him to. He plays the piano, fences, and takes Chinese lessons, not out of personal interest, but because it upholds the image of being perfect and refined. Even his kindness is shaped by this pressure—while he is naturally a kind person, how it manifests is often filtered through the persona he feels he must maintain
          . Adrien’s transformation into Cat Noir serves as an escape from these pressures. The Miraculous gives its user a suit that represents their truest self, and Cat Noir embodies Adrien’s real personality—carefree, expressive, and unfiltered. However, while this newfound freedom is liberating, it also comes with its own set of challenges.

          Season 3: Understanding His Role and Shortcomings
          <br>
          The episode Reflekdoll in Season 3 provides a critical moment in Adrien’s character arc. After temporarily switching Miraculous powers with Marinette, he gains firsthand experience of what it means to be Ladybug. This moment highlights his complacency as a hero—he realizes that while he enjoys the thrill of being Cat Noir, he sometimes prioritizes jokes and flirting over actually strategizing a solution. The episode underscores the deeper symbolism of the Miraculous: Marinette lost her freedom while Adrien gained his. It presents the balance between them exceptionally well, humanizing Adrien and emphasizing that, mask or not, his struggles with identity remain a defining aspect of who he is.

          Season 4: Struggles with Exclusion and Recognition
          <br>
          By Season 4, Adrien becomes more empathetic and mindful of Ladybug’s struggles. He starts taking things more seriously, understanding the pressure she is under as the new Guardian of the Miraculous. However, while his respect for her responsibility grows, so does the distance between them. As Ladybug takes on more duties, she unintentionally isolates Cat Noir, leaving him feeling excluded from the very partnership they built together. The weight of being sidelined eventually pushes him to surrender his Miraculous, a decision fueled by his growing realization that Ladybug no longer views him as an equal.
          This dynamic is further complicated by Adrien’s feelings for Ladybug. His love for her is a mix of admiration and deep respect, in and out of the mask. However, his lack of boundaries prevents him from addressing the imbalance in their relationship. Then again, neither Ladybug nor Marinette set boundaries either—this theme is rarely explored in the show, whether in a romantic or platonic context. Adrien’s awareness of Marinette’s feelings is nearly nonexistent, and while he doesn’t intentionally perpetuate her behavior, he could have been more mindful and communicative. There were ways he could have built a closer friendship with her without unknowingly leading her on, yet he remains dense to the situation. The museum episode, where he fails to recognize Marinette’s obvious feelings, is a testament to just how oblivious he can be.
          While Adrien’s best friend, Nino, is meant to serve as his emotional support, at times, he feels less like a fully developed character and more like a voice of reason whose only role is to pull Adrien back when necessary. His presence should provide Adrien with genuine companionship, but instead, it often feels surface-level. His dynamic with him is relatively generic, and how they interact can often lead to bad or awkward situations from weird/misguided advice from each other. This happens in the episode Animal man, where Adrien tells Nino to just tell Marinette, Nino’s crush at the time, that he likes her. He doesn’t take into account the conflicting feelings Nino must’ve had. In the episode Party Crasher, Nino tells Adrien to exclude the girls(his other friends) from the party, and ends in an embarrassing mishap with Marinette. Both of them have faults of their own, but generally their dynamic is bleak.
          <br>

          Adrien's Freedom—Or Lack Thereof
          <br>
          Adrien has always sought freedom, the ability to be his own person outside of his father’s expectations. But by the end of the series, he still remains ironically trapped. Gabriel Agreste, despite everything he has done, dies a hero, cementing the very expectations Adrien spent years struggling against. This loss is something that will no doubt haunt him. While most people experience the weight of their parents’ expectations, Adrien’s situation is unique because of the circumstances surrounding his father’s death. He can choose to listen to his father’s ideals or forge his own path, but there will always be invisible burdens—ones that we, as the audience, can’t fully see or measure, yet still feel the weight of. His father did everything for the people of Paris, and saved them so there's a heavy association of following in his or the footsteps he made for him. However, he’s finally able to have support systems that help him grieve, and lessen the pressure to conform to that. The respect he can have for father doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive and make him regress back into the same puppet he initially was. However that’s up to interpretation, and whether or not he can really be his own person is up to the audience.</p>

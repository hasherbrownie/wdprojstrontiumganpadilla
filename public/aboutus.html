      <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
      <div class="whybox">
        <p>We decided to create a fandom website centered around Miraculous Ladybug because both of us came to a consensus on wanting to work on a fan-based project. While I am a fan of the show, Maize is more indifferent. Despite our differing levels of enthusiasm, we both agreed on the significance of fan representation and engagement with the media. The Miraculous Ladybug fandom is particularly vocal about its dissatisfaction with the canonical story and character development. As someone who shares these frustrations, I felt compelled to bring attention to the numerous story flaws and offer a platform to voice these critiques. Our website aims to compile not just my personal thoughts, but also the theories and opinions of other smaller influencers within the fandom.</p>
        <p>Fan representation and the sharing of theories are essential for a show to remain relevant and continue evolving. Without active engagement and analysis, shows risk becoming stagnant—more like products of media rather than meaningful pieces of art. By engaging with and critiquing the show, we breathe life into it, helping to shape its legacy.</p>
        <p>It's crucial that we don’t invalidate or degrade the creative outputs that stem from fandoms. Every fan contribution, whether it's a critique, fan art, or fan fiction, serves as a form of expression and appreciation for the original creators and artists. These creations, from stunning visual art to beautifully written works, reflect the ingenuity and creativity of fans who take inspiration and make it their own.</p>

      <h3>Why did we make this?</h3>
      <div class="whybox"> <!-- yeah ik, top tier naming -->
        <p>We made this website to express our opinions and connect with a broader audience, even if our reach is more limited. It's important that fans, no matter how small in number, feel motivated to share their thoughts and contributions. This website serves as a space for us to not only share our personal critiques but to uplift and celebrate the creative works that stem from the fandom. It is a tribute to both the show and the passionate fans who continue to breathe new life into it. Passion and drive is unique to the people that feel it and how it manifests is ultimately up to them.</p>

        <h2>Gabriel Agreste</h2>
        <p>Gabriel Agreste is the main antagonist and the villain Hawkmoth. He gives superpowers to his victims and lets them wreak havoc in the city of Paris. He recently lost his wife and grieves distantly, pushing people away and regressing rather than looking forward and understanding the people around him. He exists as a contrast to his son as he tries desperately to look for the miraculous and gain the powers of the Black Cat (Destruction), and Ladybug (Creation). His wish was to be with his wife again and be a happy family with his son. Adrien on the other hand wishes to live with the love of his mother and remember what she would’ve wanted from him. He wishes to become a person and make her proud while Gabriel wishes to bring her back regardless of the ramifications of what he does. He wanted to watch the world burn for the sake of his wife but never considered if his wife ever wanted that, and by the end of the series he drove himself insane. He got too deep in the objective and lost his purpose and motivation being consumed by an all encompassing rage and grief.</p>

        <h2>Lila</h2>
        <p>Lila is the semi-villian/antagonist in the series and in the reboot, becomes the main villain. Her motivations are unknown besides her desire to humiliate and alienate Ladybug and bring everyone against her as well as take everything from Marinette. She wants to make Marinette’s life lonely and empty, taking away everything she has. She’s known to have multiple identities, families and lives. She has 3 foster mothers who all know different aspects of her life, different groups of friends that know her for different skills and appearances, keeping disguises on her person at all times. She is manipulative, able to convince even the people you’re closest to, to doubt your innocence or consider you actively guilty. Compared to Hawkmoth, Lila is skilled and talented. She is mysterious and compelling, introduced as the akumatized super villain chameleon, and  more consistently able to harness the power of illusions.</p>

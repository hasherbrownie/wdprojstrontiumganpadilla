      <p>
        Marinette Dupain-Cheng seems like an ordinary middle schooler, balancing her passion for fashion with helping her parents run the most beloved bakery in Paris. Adrien Agreste, on the other hand, is a famous model trying to navigate the pressures of his father’s high expectations while coping with the pain of losing his mother. Despite their vastly different lives, they cross paths at school, where they begin to discover that they share more in common than they think.
        <br>
        <br>
        Their lives take a dramatic turn when they are chosen to become Ladybug and Cat Noir, superheroes tasked with protecting Paris from powerful villains. As they juggle the weight of their responsibilities with their personal struggles, they must rely on their love for family, friends, and each other to find the strength to fight. Can these young heroes overcome their fears and rise to the challenge? Or will the burdens of their double lives tear them apart?

      <h1>Recipes for Macarons</h1>
      <h2>Ingredients for 30 macarons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups or 210g of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup or 95g of almond flour, sifted and processed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt, finely grounded</li>
        <li>3 egg whites, room temp</li>
        <li>1/4 cup or 50g of granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 drops pink gel food coloring or approximately 1 teaspoon of finely ground dried strawberry</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>For the vanilla buttercream</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup or 230g of unsalted butter, at room temp</li>
        <li>2 cups or 360g of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon or 5.7g vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons or 42.5g of heavy cream</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <h3>General Recipe</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine powdered sugar, almond flour and half of the salt in a bowl of a food processor. Process on low speed until fine, and then sift the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Alternatively, you may sift through them 5 or more times to get the same effect as the food processor. Note that using a sifter may take more time. Sift in a large bowl to avoid mess, and stop when it appears extra fine.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and add the remaining salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar until fully incorporated, adding between mixing in small amounts, and stopping when stiff peaks form. To test this, turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out. Add the vanilla and continue to beat until incorporated. Add the dye either food coloring or fruit extra is appropriate.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/3 of the almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites; use a spatula to gently fold them together. Be careful to not overmix; To test if it’s undermixed, mixed well or overmixed; attempt to create the figure eight with the spatula up. If the figure is too liquidy or can’t stick to create the figure, the batch is overmixed. If the figure is too solid and stiff, then it’s undermixed, and still needs to be incorporated well. The batter is mixed well when it can create a figure 8 that lasts for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip; typically, you don’t need a nozzle, simply cutting a small hole from the piping bag is enough to get a good shape, and is recommended. Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and place parchment paper over it to act as the adherent. Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 1.5 inch or 3 cm circlines, spaced around 1 inch or 2 cm apart. The size of your macaron can be up to you, but be mindful that different sizes may take up different cooking times. If the size of your macaron is larger, it may take more time, and if it’s smaller, it’ll generally take less. The time given here could also vary depending on oven model and temp.</li>
        <li>Tap the baking sheet on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles. Let the macarons sit at room temp for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until dry and stable to the touch.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150 C or 300 F. Back the macarons for 17 minutes or when the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper, and are easily removed. Transfer onto a cooling rack, and wait until completely cool before adding the filing.</li>
        <li>Make the buttercream in a large bowl; add the butter and beat with a mixer for 1 minute until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla, and continue beating. Add the cream gradually, and stop beating until desired consistency is reached. Transfer the buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Add a dollop of buttercream to one macaron shell and top it with another to create a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining macaron shells and butter cream. Place in an airtight container and chill in the fridge for around 24 hours, then consume.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Show Accurate</h3>
      <p>To create macarons accurate to the show, you can separate parts of the macaron batter and dye them accordingly, and cook them at a shorter time to create the kwami power up macarons.</p>
      <h3>Adrien's Favorite Macaron</h3>
      <p>To create Adrien's favorite macaron, which is passion fruit, dye the macaron shell orange-yellow, and add some passion fruit zest or dried extract. Add some passion fruit juice, lemon extract to the buttercream, and create your own fruit curd if ever you want to add more tangy and direct flavor within the macaron.</p>
      <h3>Marinette's First Day of School Pistachio Macarons</h3>
      <p>To create Marinette’s first day of school pistachio macarons, substitute around 10-20% of the almond flour with finely ground pistachios, and some light green dye to the batter. Create a pistachio ganache filling and add some white chocolate in the middle if you want to add more layers to the dessert.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>During hero’s day, Marinette brought a different flavor of macarons, and to create that, you simply had to experiment with different dyes, and flavors. Throughout the show, macarons are shown to be a core aspect of the many of the characters qualities, and also just a fun snack between different episodes.</p>

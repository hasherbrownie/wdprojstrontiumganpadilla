      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Marinette Dupain-Cheng seems like an ordinary middle schooler, balancing her passion for fashion with helping her parents run the most beloved bakery in Paris. Adrien Agreste, on the other hand, is a famous model trying to navigate the pressures of his father’s high expectations while coping with the pain of losing his mother. Despite their vastly different lives, they cross paths at school, where they begin to discover that they share more in common than they think.
        <br>
        <br>
        Their lives take a dramatic turn when they are chosen to become Ladybug and Cat Noir, superheroes tasked with protecting Paris from powerful villains. As they juggle the weight of their responsibilities with their personal struggles, they must rely on their love for family, friends, and each other to find the strength to fight. Can these young heroes overcome their fears and rise to the challenge? Or will the burdens of their double lives tear them apart?

      <h2>for Macarons</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients for 30 macarons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups or 210g of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup or 95g of almond flour, sifted and processed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt, finely grounded</li>
        <li>3 egg whites, room temp</li>
        <li>1/4 cup or 50g of granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 drops pink gel food coloring or approximately 1 teaspoon of finely ground dried strawberry</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For the vanilla buttercream</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup or 230g of unsalted butter, at room temp</li>
        <li>2 cups or 360g of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon or 5.7g vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons or 42.5g of heavy cream</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <h4>General Recipe</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine powdered sugar, almond flour and half of the salt in a bowl of a food processor. Process on low speed until fine, and then sift the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Alternatively, you may sift through them 5 or more times to get the same effect as the food processor. Note that using a sifter may take more time. Sift in a large bowl to avoid mess, and stop when it appears extra fine.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and add the remaining salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar until fully incorporated, adding between mixing in small amounts, and stopping when stiff peaks form. To test this, turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out. Add the vanilla and continue to beat until incorporated. Add the dye either food coloring or fruit extra is appropriate.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add about 1/3 of the almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites; use a spatula to gently fold them together. Be careful to not overmix; To test if it’s undermixed, mixed well or overmixed; attempt to create the figure eight with the spatula up. If the figure is too liquidy or can’t stick to create the figure, the batch is overmixed. If the figure is too solid and stiff, then it’s undermixed, and still needs to be incorporated well. The batter is mixed well when it can create a figure 8 that lasts for a few seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip; typically, you don’t need a nozzle, simply cutting a small hole from the piping bag is enough to get a good shape, and is recommended. Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and place parchment paper over it to act as the adherent. Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 1.5 inch or 3 cm circlines, spaced around 1 inch or 2 cm apart. The size of your macaron can be up to you, but be mindful that different sizes may take up different cooking times. If the size of your macaron is larger, it may take more time, and if it’s smaller, it’ll generally take less. The time given here could also vary depending on oven model and temp.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Tap the baking sheet on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles. Let the macarons sit at room temp for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until dry and stable to the touch.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150 C or 300 F. Back the macarons for 17 minutes or when the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper, and are easily removed. Transfer onto a cooling rack, and wait until completely cool before adding the filing.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make the buttercream in a large bowl; add the butter and beat with a mixer for 1 minute until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla, and continue beating. Add the cream gradually, and stop beating until desired consistency is reached. Transfer the buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Add a dollop of buttercream to one macaron shell and top it with another to create a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining macaron shells and butter cream. Place in an airtight container and chill in the fridge for around 24 hours, then consume.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Show Accurate</h4>
      <p>To create macarons accurate to the show, you can separate parts of the macaron batter and dye them accordingly, and cook them at a shorter time to create the kwami power up macarons.</p>
      <h4>Adrien's Favorite Macaron</h4>
      <p>To create Adrien's favorite macaron, which is passion fruit, dye the macaron shell orange-yellow, and add some passion fruit zest or dried extract. Add some passion fruit juice, lemon extract to the buttercream, and create your own fruit curd if ever you want to add more tangy and direct flavor within the macaron.</p>
      <h4>Marinette's First Day of School Pistachio Macarons</h4>
      <p>To create Marinette’s first day of school pistachio macarons, substitute around 10-20% of the almond flour with finely ground pistachios, and some light green dye to the batter. Create a pistachio ganache filling and add some white chocolate in the middle if you want to add more layers to the dessert.</p>
      <h4>Hero's Day Celebration Macarons</h4>
      <p>During hero’s day, Marinette brought a different flavor of macarons, and to create that, you simply had to experiment with different dyes, and flavors. Throughout the show, macarons are shown to be a core aspect of the many of the characters qualities, and also just a fun snack between different episodes.</p>
      <h2>for Chocolate Cake</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups or 185g of flour</li>
        <li>1 cup or 120g of cocoa powder/chocolate extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon or 6g of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon or 7.5g of baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon or 2g of baking powder</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups or 360m of stout</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon or 13.5g of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon or 7g of espresso powder/coffee grinds</li>
        <p>The amount of vanilla and this can vary depending on how bitter and flavorful you want the cake to be; the point of baking is to make things you’d enjoy, so simply roughly sticking to this will be enough to make something edible. Don’t overdo it to a point where the ratio is considerably turned around.</p>
        <li>1 cup or 235g of butter</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups or 300g of sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 or 120 g of mayonnaise</li>
        <li>4oz or 115g of dark chocolate, finely chopped or grinded, in chunks</li>
        <p>Any form is acceptable, and can be catered to preferences</p>
      </ul>
      <h4>Buttercream</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups or 350g of butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon or 13.5g of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup or 60g of cocoa powder</li>
        <li>5 cups or 600g of powdered sugar</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons or 75g of milk</li>
        <li>Fresh fruit, chocolate to decorate</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Grease and line cake tin/s with parchment paper. Be mindful, different sizes could indicate different cook times. An 8 inch or 20cm cake will bake for around 35 minutes, but a better indicator would be the toothpick test; to do this, insert a toothpick or fork into the center of the cake, and if it comes out clean, then it’s ready. Remember to evenly distribute, and mindful that the cake will rise, so don’t overfill the tin, leave some space for leeway.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large measuring cup, combine stout, vanilla, and expresso powder. Set this aside for later. In a large mixing bow, cream together butter and sugar until it’s light and fluffy; scrape down the sides occasionally to ensure all the ingredients are being evenly creamed together for 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time ensuring it’s fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the mayonnaise and beat until mixture is smooth and creamy. Preheat the oven to 325 F or 160 C. Alternate adding the wet and dry ingredients to the batter. Starting with about 1/3 of the dry ingredients, mix and then add 1/3 of the liquid ingredients, mixing until it comes together. Continue until there aren’t any more wet or dry ingredients left. Using a rubber spatula, fold the dark chocolate chunks, fruit or other items into the batter.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake for the desired time(8 inch pan- 35 minutes). Place the cakes on a cooling rack and leave to fully cool (until outside of the pan is easy to touch). Once cooled, loosen the edges with a butter knife and place on a large plate and invert to release the cake from the pan. Remove the parchment paper, and repeat for the rest of the cake tins if more than one.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the butter cream; beat together vanilla and butter, gradually add the cocoa powder, powdered sugar and milk. Continuously beat until everything has been incorporated and frosting is light and fluffy. Frost and decorate to your preferences, and then eat!</li>
        <p>Cakes are an important food and concept within the show. It’s shown in many episodes for different events as well as situations. The cake made during marinette’s birthday kept getting made over and over again because of mistakes that ruined the final product or even the cake during the akumatization of the bubbler during adrien’s birthday. There are cakes during the gathering after hero’s day to celebrate the hard work and dedication of everyone in Paris and especially their superheroes that risk their lives, and marinette made a cake as part of her dessert buffet during that day. Cakes are important in our world as a tasty treat and in the show as an overall plot point.</p>

      <h2>for Crepes</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups or 250g of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup or 55g of butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons or 37.5g of granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups or 720 ml of milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup or 115g of hazelnut spread</li>
        <p>Doesn't have to be hazelnut, can be chocolate, strawberry, vanila, etc.</p>
        <li>10 strawberries, sliced</li>
        <p>Doesn't have to be strawberry, can be other fruit or none at all</p>
        <li>Powdered sugar, garnish</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <p>In a large bowl, combine flour eggs, butter, and sugar stirring until all ingredients are mixed. Add the milk gradually until the batter is smooth and liquidy, and have no lumps. In a pan over medium heat, pour 1/3 cup or 95 g of batter in the center and swirl the batter around the edges of the pan until set. To know when to flip the crepe, check by flipping the edge, and seeing it's golden brown, and if it is, flip. Cook until the edges are starting to crisp or cave in. Remove from the heat and cover with a paper towel to make sure it stays moist. Add the spread, fruit and/or more toppings, and enjoy!</p>
      <p>Within the show, one of the biggest moments is when Marinette stood up to Gabriel. In the episode "Pretension", Gabriel Agreste offers Marinette a crepe, symbolizing a choice between accepting his terms or having nothing. Marinette declines, stating, "You know what the problem with your crepes are? They have too much flour and not enough butter. You use an outdated recipe; no one likes them like that anymore." This moment underscores her resistance to Gabriel's manipulative tactics, and his outdated parenting styles and attitudes are the reason why no one will ever like the real him.</p>

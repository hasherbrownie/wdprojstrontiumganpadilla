Title: A Requiem to Miraculous

The website is a collection of character analyses and criticisms of the children’s show _Miraculous Ladybug_, aimed at fans and viewers interested in its storytelling and characters. While the show’s mature premise and literary themes have garnered a dedicated fanbase, it is not exempt from criticism. This website serves as an organized, streamlined alternative to scattered fan discussions on platforms like YouTube and Reddit, offering an accessible summary of collective opinions and theories. Balancing a lighthearted tone with serious critiques, it provides entertainment while highlighting flaws in character development and narrative structure.

The website has four main sections: About Us, Storyline, Gallery, and Characters. The About Us introduces the project’s purpose and origin. The _Storyline_ summarizes each season’s key events and notable flaws. The _Gallery_ showcases fan art with optional tangents and opinions. The core focus, the _Characters_ section, dedicates pages to analyzing individual personas, such as Marinette’s unrealistic journey as the protagonist, Adrien’s lack of character development, and Hawkmoth’s weak motivations. All analyses are supported by sourced fan content, ensuring a blend of entertainment and thoughtful critique.

There's gonna be a small game where you can make cake too, since the main character lives in a bakery, and that's also where JS will be used.
It'll be kinda like this: https://www.abcya.com/games/make-a-cake

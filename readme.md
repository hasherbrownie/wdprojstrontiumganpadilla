Title: A Requiem to Miraculous 

The website is a collection of character analyses and criticisms of the children’s show *Miraculous Ladybug*, aimed at fans and viewers interested in its storytelling and characters. While the show’s mature premise and literary themes have garnered a dedicated fanbase, it is not exempt from criticism. This website serves as an organized, streamlined alternative to scattered fan discussions on platforms like YouTube and Reddit, offering an accessible summary of collective opinions and theories. Balancing a lighthearted tone with serious critiques, it provides entertainment while highlighting flaws in character development and narrative structure.

The website has four main sections: About Us, Storyline, Gallery, and Characters. The About Us introduces the project’s purpose and origin. The *Storyline* summarizes each season’s key events and notable flaws. The *Gallery* showcases fan art with optional tangents and opinions. The core focus, the *Characters* section, dedicates pages to analyzing individual personas, such as Marinette’s unrealistic journey as the protagonist, Adrien’s lack of character development, and Hawkmoth’s weak motivations. All analyses are supported by sourced fan content, ensuring a blend of entertainment and thoughtful critique.

So basically, we're gonna make a commenting page. There'll be comment sections for each character. Then we're gonna save their comments to a json file.
It'll look like this:

Type of data: Comment data\
purpose: for posting and storing people's thoughts/comments\
structure in JSON format:\
comment {\
   title: text-string,\
   commentbody: text-string,\
   dateposted: date\
}

We're also gonna add a criticism page. In that page, we're gonna dump all our critiques of the show and stuff. Doesn't have any persistent data, but that's covered with the page above already.
